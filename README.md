# Planetary System Drawer and Generator
This project consists mainly of 2 parts:

## A planetary system drawer
The drawer uses pycairo to draw a png based on the planetary system information.

The drawing consists of a 2d representation of the planetary system.

PIL can be used to apply noise to the image to make it have texture.

The method that draws the system is recursive since a system is defined as an object and a list of systems.

## A few, real life planetary systems

Including of course:
* The solar system

But also some extra-solar systems:
* Kepler-11
* Trappist-1

## A planetary system generator

WIP

## Example

The solar system, objects radii to scale, distances __not__ to scale
